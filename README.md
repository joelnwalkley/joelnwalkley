# Hello, World!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects with [Evidence-Based Associates](https://evidencebasedassociates.com/):
  - [Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice Provider Directory](https://vamap.evidencebasedassociates.com/)
  - Provider Web Portal for the Washington D.C. Project (not publically accessible)
  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His/Him.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Full-stack web-development (interested in the "FERN" stack: Firebase, Express, React, Node)
  - Java
  
âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I earned by bachelor's degree in computer science over 15 years ago before going to seminary upon the recommendation of a mentor who suggested I study something to be more well rouneded. Unable to find full-time ministry work I pursued human services and eventually became a social worker. During Covid, I was facing a layoff due to the loss of federal funding for a project and came full circle to land my first full-time tech position in 2020. So, I am a social worker who knows how to code.
