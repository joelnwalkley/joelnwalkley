# Hello, World!
  
😄 Pronouns: He/His/Him.

👨🏻‍💻 I currently work on:
  - Full-stack web-development: React & Node.js (with TypeScript), connecting with various database models.
  - Database modeling for efficient storage and retrieval.
  - API development including RESTful services & GraphQL.

🌱 I'm learning/growing skills in:
  - Architectural project design.
  - UI/UX, especially CSS.
  - Cloud: DevOps, CI/CD, Docker & microservices.
   
  
⚡ Fun facts:
  - I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science in 2005 before attending seminary. A dear mentor suggested I study something practical in order to become more well rounded. I was unable to find full-time ministry work at the height of the Great Recession circa 2009. So, I pursued a human services career in addition to leading a local congregation, eventually becoming a social worker. I love that I have been able to use my tech skills to bring tangible solutions to human service challenges. During the global Covid pandemic, I was at a crossroads following the end of a federally funded project and decided to lean more heavily into tech. So, I am a pastor and social worker who knows how to code.

💬 Coding Philosophy:
   - Software, an app, a website, or any bit of technology exists first and foremost to solve a human problem or meet a need. Or to put that in another way: the code does not exist for its own sake. Never lose sight of the human context when developing technology solutions.
