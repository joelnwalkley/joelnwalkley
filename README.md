# Hello, World!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on two projects with [Evidence-Based Associates](https://evidencebasedassociates.com/) as an Independent Contractor:
  - [Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice Provider Directory](https://vamap.evidencebasedassociates.com/)
  - Provider Web Portal for the Washington D.C. Families First Project (not publicly accessible)
  
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/His/Him.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Full-stack web-development (interested in the "FERN" stack: Firebase, Express, React, Node)
  - Java
  
âš¡ Fun facts:
  - I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science about 15 years ago before going to seminary. I chose this path upon the recommendation of a dear mentor who suggested I study something to become more well rounded. When I was unable to find full-time ministry work at the height of the Great Recession I pursued a human services career in addition to leading a local congregation, eventually becoming a social worker. I love that I have been able to put my tech skills to work throughout my career. During the global Covid pandemic, I was facing a layoff due to the loss of federal funding for a project and decided to lean more heavily into tech. So, I am a pastor and social worker who knows how to code.

ðŸ’¬ Coding Philosophy:
   - Software, an app, a website, or any bit of technology exists first and foremost to solve a human problem or meet a need. Or to put that it in another way: the code does not exist for its own sake. Never lose sight of the human context when developing technology solutions.
